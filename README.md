I'm a software developer with a background in audio engineering, focusing on Rust and systems programming. My journey from artist to technologist has shaped my approach to problem-solving and software design.

This transition was a mix of chance interactions and calculated leaps into the unknown.

Rust is my tool of choice, because it's a philosophy and principles regarding memory safety and precision mirror the process of audio engineering in way that resonates with me.
